= Introduction to the development of browser based applications

== Introduction

Sequence of exercises to illustrate the loading and execution of scripts in the browser, as well as the `document` API.

== Document and scripts loading

* Start by installing link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve[serve] as a way to easily serve files from a local folder via the HTTP protocol.
** `npm install --global serve`
* Create an empty folder and add an HTML file named `index.html` to it.
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1 id="main-heading">Hello World</h1>
    </body>
</html>
----

* Start `serve` on the created folder
** E.g. `serve .`

* Open the browser in `http://localhost:3000` (confirm port on the information produced by serve).
** Observe result in browser.
** Open the browser's development tools and observe the network requests.
** Notice how a `GET` to `/` returns the content of `index.html` in the response message body.
** Rename the HTML file to `index2.html` and see the result in the browser.
*** Notice how the `index.html` has a special meaning to the *server*. What is this "special meaning"?
*** Does it have a special meaning to the browser?
** Rename the HTML file back to `index.html`.
* Change the address to `http://localhost:3000/index.html` and observe the result.
* Create a file `s1.js` with
----
console.log("I'm s1")
const mainHeading = document.getElementById("main-heading")
console.log(mainHeading)
const something = "hello"
console.log(something)
----
* Add `<script src="s1.js"></script>` to the HTML file `head` element.
** Observe the result in the console.
** What is `document`?
** What does `document.getElementById("main-heading")` do?
** Why is `console.log(mainHeading)` presenting  `null`?
* Create a file `s2.js` with
----
console.log("I'm s2")
const something = "world"
console.log(something)
----
* Add `<script src="s2.js"></script>` to the HTML file `head` element.
** Observe the result of reloading the HTML document.
** Why is there an error in the console?
* Add the attribute `type="module"` to the `script` element for `s1.js`.
** What is the value presented for `console.log(mainHeading)`?
** Does the previous error still exists? Why?

== Javascript modules

* Create a file `add.js` with
----
console.log("Look, I'm running in a browser")
export function add(x,y){
    return x + y;
}
----
* Add `<script src="add.js"></script>` to the HTML file `head` element.
** Observe the error in the console.
** Remove `add.js` from `index.html`.

* Add the following to the beginning of both `s1.js` and `s2.js`
----
import { add } from './add.js'
console.log(add(1,2))
----
** Make sure that the loading of `s1.js` has the `"module"` type and the loading of `s2.js` does not.
** What is the error occurring during the document loading and why does it happen?
** Add the `"module"` type to the loading of `s2.js`.
** Observe the output in the console.
*** Is the error still occurring?
*** Is the result of the call to `add` being shown correctly?
*** How many times is `Look, I'm running in a browser` presented?
** Observe all HTTP requests made by the browser?
*** How many HTTP requests would there be if the application used `N` modules?
